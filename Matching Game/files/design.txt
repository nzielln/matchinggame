        Methods: __init__()
    - Cards
        Attribute: name, image, x, y, back_stamp, card_stamp, clicked, instances
        Methods: __eq__(), __init__()
    - Board
        Attribute: name, tur, x, y, stamp, instances
        Methods: __init__()

Data Structures
    Dictionaries to store large data, Lists to store smaller, temporary data that was only needed in a couple of functions or needed to run loops, Tuples for storing data from dictionary and classes in order to use/loop through them, Classes to store data for on_click functions.

Testing:
    My approach to testing my game was to play under multiple scenerios (with required files missing, using different number cards, entering incorrect values, etc) and seeing how the game behaved. I also found it helpful to have other people play the game in case they interacted with the game differently. Based on how the game behaved under these circustamces, I made changes to make sure that a game is still playable even if a couple of files/parameters are missing. Certain parameters that were required for the game had to be provided in order to continue, however, if a parameter was not necessary, the game will continue with defautl parameters.
